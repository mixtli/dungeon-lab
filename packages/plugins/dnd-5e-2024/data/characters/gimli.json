  "description": "A proud dwarven warrior whose fierce loyalty and mighty axe make him a formidable member of the Fellowship. Son of Glóin, he initially carries his people's ancient prejudices, but through his friendship with Legolas, he helps bridge the divide between elves and dwarves. His skill in battle is matched only by his passionate defense of dwarven culture and his growing appreciation for the beauty of the elven realms.",
