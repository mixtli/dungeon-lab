# DungeonLab Mobile Optimization Plan

> **Note:** GM-only tools are only required to be supported on desktop and tablets. We will not attempt to implement GM-only tools on mobile/phone devices. All GM management and advanced encounter controls are desktop/tablet only.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for optimizing DungeonLab's virtual tabletop system for mobile devices. The plan addresses both standard application pages and the specialized encounter runner that uses Pixi.js for real-time gaming.
