# DungeonLab Mobile Optimization Plan

> **Update (2024-06): DungeonLab will be a PWA with a native-app look and feel on mobile.**
> - **Mobile app = PWA**: No separate native app; we use Progressive Web App features for installability and app-like UX.
> - **Bottom navigation bar**: On mobile, players get a bottom tab bar for quick switching between main views.
> - **Player-only on mobile**: Only player features are supported on mobile/phone. GM tools are desktop/tablet only.

## Executive Summary

DungeonLab will deliver a mobile experience via a Progressive Web App (PWA) that looks and feels like a native app. The mobile UI will feature a bottom navigation bar for players, providing fast access to the most important views: Character Sheet, Encounter Runner, Chat, and Settings. All GM/administrative tools will remain desktop/tablet only, greatly simplifying the mobile experience and focusing on player needs.
