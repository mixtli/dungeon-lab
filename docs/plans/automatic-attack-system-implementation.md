# Automatic Attack System Implementation Plan

**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Author:** AI Assistant  
**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Estimated Duration:** 8-10 days  
**Priority:** High  
**Related Proposal:** [Automatic Attack System Architecture](../proposals/automatic-attack-system.md)

## Executive Summary

This plan implements the automatic attack system architecture for Dungeon Lab's D&D 5e plugin. The system enhances existing manual weapon workflows with optional automation via character sheet checkboxes, using a hybrid architecture combining socket events for player communication and action handlers for game state mutations.

**Key Features:**
- Backwards compatible - all existing manual workflows remain unchanged
- Hybrid communication model separating player interaction from state management
- Local character sheet automation controls (not campaign-wide settings)
- Real-time damage roll requests via socket events
- Atomic damage application via action handlers
- Graceful fallbacks to manual mode on any errors

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **RollHandlerContext Enhancement** - Add `requestAction` and `requestRoll` functions
2. **Socket Infrastructure** - `roll:request` event routing for GM-to-player communication
3. **Apply-Damage Action Handler** - Atomic HP mutations with validation
4. **Enhanced Weapon Handlers** - Auto-mode branching with socket events
5. **Character Sheet Integration** - Local automation checkboxes
6. **Chat Components** - Roll request UI for players

### Communication Flow
```
Player → Attack Roll → GM Client → Hit Determination → Socket Event → Player → Damage Roll → GM Client → Action Handler → Game State Update
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Automatic attack system works end-to-end when enabled
- [ ] Manual attack workflow remains completely unchanged
- [ ] Local character sheet automation controls function correctly
- [ ] Real-time damage roll requests work via socket events
- [ ] Atomic damage application via action handlers
- [ ] Critical hit logic properly doubles dice (not modifiers)
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful fallbacks to manual mode

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing manual workflows
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns (socket events vs action handlers)
- [ ] Action handlers follow existing patterns and architecture
- [ ] Socket events are properly validated and routed
- [ ] TypeScript compilation with no errors
- [ ] All tests pass including existing test suite
- [ ] Performance within acceptable bounds

### User Experience Requirements  
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for automation state
- [ ] Helpful error messages for troubleshooting
- [ ] Intuitive UI for enabling/disabling automation
- [ ] Smooth real-time interaction for damage roll requests
- [ ] No confusion between manual and automatic modes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Socket event failures**: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback to manual mode
- **Action handler errors**: Use existing GM Action Handler error recovery patterns  
- **Performance impact**: Monitor and optimize real-time event processing
- **State synchronization**: Leverage existing atomic update patterns

### User Experience Risks
- **Feature complexity**: Provide clear documentation and intuitive UI design
- **Learning curve**: Maintain familiar manual workflows as fallback
- **Error confusion**: Implement clear error messages and recovery guidance

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the automatic attack system while maintaining full backward compatibility and following established architectural patterns.
