**Key Architectural Achievement**: The unified action handler pattern is now fully operational for attack spells, providing a single function that handles all spell casting complexity while maintaining clean separation between validation, execution, and effect application.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principle
Implement infrastructure first, then build incrementally from simple to complex spell mechanics. Each phase builds on the previous phase's foundations.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Single unified `executeSpellCast` function handles all spell types (ready for implementation)
- ✅ Local variable persistence throughout complete spell workflows  
- ✅ Promise-based roll request/response correlation
- ✅ Atomic success/failure for complete spell operations
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and timeout management
- ✅ Full backward compatibility with existing action handler system
- ✅ **Unified roll processing pipeline** - Both direct rolls and roll requests use identical logic
- ✅ **Pure function architecture** - Roll handlers are testable and side-effect free
- ✅ **Eliminated code duplication** - No separate processing paths for different roll sources
- ✅ **pluginContext.getDocument() integration** - Spell lookup uses compendium access
- ✅ **Character and Actor Support** - Both document types supported as casters/targets
- ✅ **Spell Slot Management** - Full slot consumption and tracking implementation
- ✅ **D&D Calculation Engine** - Attack bonus, spell DC, and ability score integration

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to building the unified action handler spell casting system. By implementing infrastructure first and building incrementally from simple to complex mechanics, we can ensure a robust, well-tested system that dramatically improves the developer experience for complex game mechanics while maintaining full backward compatibility.

The phased approach allows for course correction and ensures we have working functionality at each milestone, reducing project risk and enabling early user testing and feedback.
