## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
1. **D&D Implementation (Week 3)**: Complex game system functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, clean implementation from scratch
   - **Fallback**: Revert to current architecture (users would need to migrate back)

2. **Plugin Hot Reload (Week 1-2)**: Technical complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Prototype early, test thoroughly
   - **Fallback**: Accept slower development cycle

3. **User Adoption (Week 11-12)**: Market risk
   - **Mitigation**: Beta testing, community building
   - **Fallback**: Focus on existing D&D users

### Contingency Plans
- **Timeline Slippage**: Cut scope, focus on core features
- **Technical Issues**: Pair programming with Claude, external consultation
- **Market Response**: Pivot to most successful system, double down

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- [ ] Vue 3 development environment
- [ ] TypeScript 5.0+
- [ ] Vite build system
- [ ] Testing frameworks (Vitest, Playwright)

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2

The plugin architecture implementation is now complete and functional. The system successfully auto-discovers plugins, provides a complete development environment, and serves the D&D 5e plugin to users through the settings interface.

### What's Working
- ✅ Server-side plugin auto-discovery via filesystem scanning
- ✅ Socket-based real-time communication for all plugin operations
- ✅ Actor and item management via socket events with callbacks
- ✅ Vue 3 component architecture with TypeScript
- ✅ D&D 5e plugin with character sheets and mechanics
- ✅ Hot reload development environment
- ✅ Session-based socket authentication
- ✅ TypeScript socket event schemas and handlers
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Plugin metadata system via package.json
- ✅ Complete plugin lifecycle management

### Implementation Details
- **Server Plugin Discovery**: Scans `packages/plugins` directory for valid plugins
- **Plugin Metadata**: Uses `dungeonLab` field in package.json for plugin configuration
- **Socket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication via Socket.io events
  - `actor:list`, `actor:get`, `actor:update`, `actor:delete` with callbacks
  - `item:list`, `item:get`, `item:create`, `item:update`, `item:delete` with callbacks
- **Client Integration**: Web app loads plugins and communicates via socket events
- **Authentication**: Socket connections require valid session authentication
- **TypeScript Integration**: Proper typing for socket events without `any` usage

### Ready for Phase 2
The project is now ready to move into Phase 2 (Market Entry) with the implementation of additional game systems like Basic Fantasy RPG and Old School Essentials.
