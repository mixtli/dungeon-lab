# Plugin Architecture Implementation Task List

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of tasks for implementing the In-House Plugin Architecture strategy. This is a **greenfield project** with no backward compatibility requirements for the legacy plugin system. Tasks are organized by phase with estimated timeframes, dependencies, and success criteria.

## References

**Plugin Strategy**: [Plugin Strategy](plugin-architecture-strategy.md)
**Plugin Architecture Plan**: [In House Architecture](in-house-plugin-architecture.md)

**Total Timeline**: 12 weeks to full market launch
**Infrastructure Cleanup**: Week 0
**New Architecture Implementation**: Weeks 1-6
