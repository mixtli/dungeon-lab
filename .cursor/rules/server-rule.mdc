The server is a nodejs app using the express framework.

All code should be written in typescript.   Always use the extension .mts if possible.  When importing, we must always import the file with an ".mjs" extension.


We use session authentication.  Sessions are stored in mongodb.   The server creates a session cookie and passes it to the client.  The User object is added to the session object.   

Do NOT modify any authentication related code without asking me first.   Ever.  We already have auth middleware in [auth.middleware.mts](mdc:packages/server/src/middleware/auth.middleware.mts).   


# Routes
All api routes should start with /api


# OpenAPI
We run swagger at http://localhost:3000/swaggerui.  The OpenAPI Schema is hosted at http://localhost:3000/openapi.json.  If you are writing code to connect to the api and are unsure of the structure of the REST API, look there.  You should add openapi documentation to any routes you create by using the methods openApiGet, openApiPost, etc from oapi.mts

# Code structure
- Major features should be organized together in src/features.  For example, all code related to campaigns should go in src/features/campaigns.   


Restarting the Server:
When I'm developing, the server is running with tsx --watch.   We should not need to restart the server manually for changes to take effect in most cases.
