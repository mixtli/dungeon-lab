The server is a nodejs app using the express framework.

All code should be written in typescript.   Always use the extension .mts if possible.  When importing, we must always import the file with an ".mjs" extension.


We use session authentication.  Sessions are stored in mongodb.   The server creates a session cookie and passes it to the client.  The User object is added to the session object.   

Do NOT modify any authentication related code without asking me first.   Ever.  We already have auth middleware in [auth.middleware.mts](mdc:packages/server/src/middleware/auth.middleware.mts).   


Restarting the Server:
When I'm developing, the server is running with tsx --watch.   We should not need to restart the server manually for changes to take effect in most cases.
