# Troubleshooting Guide

## Storing Errors in persistent state

* Errors and their resolutions will be stored in a persistent state using the memento mcp.
* Whenever we encounter an error, search the memento mcp for similar errors we have seen in the past.
* When we resolve an error store the following:
    * The error message if any
    * A description of the error
    * How the error was resolved.

## Debugging


### General guidelines
* Use console.debug to log debugging information
* Most of the time you don't need to restart to see a change.  We are running with hot reloading.

### Server debugging
* We will attach the cursor debugger to the node process to set breakpoints.

### Web debugging
* Currently we debug by running Chrome in debug mode through cursor launch settings.
