# Troubleshooting Guide

## Storing Errors in persistent state

* Errors and their resolutions will be stored in a persistent state using the memento mcp.
* Whenever we encounter an error, search the memento mcp for similar errors we have seen in the past.
* When we resolve an error store the following:
    * The error message if any
    * A description of the error
    * How the error was resolved.

## Debugging


### General guidelines
* Use console.debug to log debugging information
* Most of the time you don't need to restart to see a change.  We are running with hot reloading.

### Server debugging
* We will attach the cursor debugger to the node process to set breakpoints.
* The server automatically restarting when you change code.  There is no reason to start it yourself.
* The server outputs logs to [server.log](mdc:packages/server/logs/server.log).   You can look at the file to see recent errors.
* The base url of the server is http://localhost:3000
* Openapi documentation for the routes is available at http://localhost:3000/openapi.json

### Web debugging
* Currently we debug by running Chrome in debug mode through cursor launch settings.  
* You can use the playwright mcp to test functionality in the UI.  The base url is http://localhost:8080  
* YOu can use the browser-tools mcp to see browser logs, browser errors, network logs, and take screenshots.
* The development web server is run by vite and has hot reloading.   It will see your code changes without restarting.  There is no reason to restart it.
