- Use Vue 3 script setup style components always
- Use typescript for all code.
- All typescript files should use esm syntax
- All typescript files should have a .mts extension if possible.
- Never install a component library without asking.
- Pages connected to the router are in the src/views directory.
- Never receive or send _id fields for models.  On the web client we should always send and receive id as a string.  Mongoose in the server should handle any translation to _id.
- Do not use element-plus

# Server communication
- The client can call APIs on the server.  All api routes should start with /api
- The client can also communicate with the server via websocket.  The client should always use socket.io for websocket communication.
