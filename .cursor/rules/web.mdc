description: Basic rules that apply to the entirety of the web client
globs: packages/web/*
alwaysApply: false

- Use Vue 3 script setup style components always
- Use typescript for all code.
- All typescript files should use esm syntax
- All typescript files should have a .mts extension if possible.
- Never install a component library without asking.
- Never receive or send _id fields for models.  On the web client we should always send and receive id.  Mongoose in the server should handle any translation to _id.
- Do not use element-plus


- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
